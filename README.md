# The WSB Ticker Bot
This bot will notify you when DD mentioning a particular stock or stocks
is posted.

This lets you buy in right after you scroll to the TLDR 
without reading any of the text

The bot can pick tickers out of posts and leave a comment offering people to subscribe, but right now it's rate limited by karma and the >1 month account age limit on WSB. It'll be doing that soon

---

## How to use
* Send the bot a message or comment on something its posted like `$AAPL $UCO` and you'll be notified when DD mentioning `AAPL` or `UCO` is posted
* Send it `STOP $AAPL` to be unsubscribed from `$AAPL` DD
* Right now the bot scans all new posts with the `DD`, `Fundamentals`, `Stocks`, and `Discussion` flairs

If this bot helped your tendies print consider leaving a tip and I swear to piss it away on FDs

If you lost money because you read some shit DD then open up the door to the back porch, head outside, smoke some weed and chill the fuck out. Money isn't everything. Except when you yolo your parent's 100k retirement fund. But hey, maybe if you'd seen the right DD that wouldn't have happened
