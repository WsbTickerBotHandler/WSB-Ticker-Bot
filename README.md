I'll set the scene for you. It's 1:03pm on a Friday. You've just worked hard to finish page 8 of the coloring book your wife's boyfriend bought you for Christmas last year. You deserve a break. Before nap time, you open RH only to see a 4x gilded post circle-jerking over the 10-bagger earnings play they've been milking over the last week. You stare, blank faced at the post. Your brain faintly remembers the ticker from months ago when your friend told you the company would blow up during the beer virus. The rage builds even as the half-eaten crayon hanging out of the side of your mouth wets with drool. A single syllable _guhhhh_ releases from your mouth as you realize the tendies could have been yours if only your feeble brain had processed enough TLDRs to fool you into buying a call

Or...

* Send [/u/WSBStockTickerBot](https://www.reddit.com/user/WSBStockTickerBot) a message or comment on something it's posted. **Chat is not supported by Reddit for bots please make sure you send a DM or respond to a [/u/WSBStockTickerBot](https://www.reddit.com/user/WSBStockTickerBot) comment**
  * Example: `$AAPL $UCO` will subscribe you to the `$AAPL` and `$UCO` tickers
* Use a message with stop at the beginning to be unsubscribed from specific tickers
  * Example: `STOP $AAPL`
* Use `STOP ALL` to unsubscribe from the "ALL DD" feed

## A couple things to know
* If you subscribed to an individual ticker you'll be notified of new posts with the `DD` flair for that ticker
* If you subscribed to the "ALL" feed, you'll be notified of new posts 

## Need some help
* Currently, the bot can be rate-limited when making posts. If you can give the bot some orange arrows would help. I'd like to have the bot post on rising DD-flaired posts with the tickers it finds in them to help other people find and use it
* If you find any issues or have a suggestion or feature you'd like to see, send a message to [/u/WSBTickerBotHandler](https://www.reddit.com/user/WSBTickerBotHandler) or open an issue/PR here https://github.com/WsbTickerBotHandler/WSB-Ticker-Bot

If this bot helped your tendies print consider leaving a tip and I swear to piss it away on FDs or use it to operate the bot

If you lost money because you read some shit DD then open up the door to the back porch, head outside, smoke some weed and chill the fuck out. Money isn't everything. Except when you yolo your parent's 100k retirement fund. But hey, maybe if you'd seen the right DD that wouldn't have happened
