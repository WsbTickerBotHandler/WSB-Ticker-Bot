I'll set the scene for you. It's 1:03pm on a Friday. You've just worked hard to finish page 8 of the coloring book your wife's boyfriend bought you for Christmas last year. You deserve a break. Before nap time, you open RH only to see a 4x gilded post circle-jerking over the 10-bagger earnings play they've been milking over the last week. You stare, blank faced at the post. Your brain faintly remembers the ticker from months ago when your friend told you the company would blow up during the beer virus. The rage builds even as the half-eaten crayon hanging out of the side of your mouth wets with drool. A single syllable _guhhhh_ releases from your mouth as you realize the tendies could have been yours if only your feeble brain had processed enough TLDRs to fool you into buying a call


# If this sounds like you, I've built something to help you out next time you need someone to hold your hand while you confidently swipe up on some OTM weeklies

/u/WSBStockTickerBot scans /r/wsb's new posts and will notify you when DD is posted that includes tickers that you're interested in.

## How to use
* Send /u/WSBStockTickerBot a message or comment on something it's posted **Chat is not supported by Reddit for bots please make sure you send a DM or respond to a /u/WSBStockTickerBot comment**
  * Example: "`$AAPL $UCO`" will subscribe you to the `$AAPL` and `$UCO` tickers
* Use a message with "stop" at the beginning to be unsubscribed
  * Example: "`STOP $AAPL`"
* Right now the bot scans all new posts with the `DD`, `Fundamentals`, and `Discussion` flairs
* The bot runs every 15 minutes so it will take at most that long to be notified of posts in the 15-minute window since you subscribed

## Need some help
* Currently, the bot gets rate-limited when making posts, so if you can **upvote its comments** that would help a lot. I'd like to have the bot post on rising DD-flaired posts with the tickers it finds in them to help other people find it and use it
* If you find any issues or have a suggestion or feature you'd like to see, send a message to /u/WSBTickerBotHandler or open an issue/PR here https://github.com/WsbTickerBotHandler/WSB-Ticker-Bot

If this bot helped your tendies print consider leaving a tip and I swear to piss it away on FDs

If you lost money because you read some shit DD then open up the door to the back porch, head outside, smoke some weed and chill the fuck out. Money isn't everything. Except when you yolo your parent's 100k retirement fund. But hey, maybe if you'd seen the right DD that wouldn't have happened
